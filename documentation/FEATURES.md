- [x]  **Projects**: A project is a concept that is being used to group together data and related information of an analysis so that a user can easily manage the multiple analysis that the user will perform on different data sets that may not be related to one another. Having projects allows us to organize the data in neatly packed containers so that the user can easily focus on his/her data analysis activities.
- [-]  **Data Sources**: A data source can be database that contains data that a user wants to bring into the platform to analyse. The aim is to provide support for multiple datasets so that the users can perform all of their analysis in this single platform without having to go back and forth from one software to another.

- [x] **Data Models**: A data model is the representation of the data that the user will build which will then be used for analysis.

- [x] **Custom Calculated Fields**: The user will be able to create new custom fields which will further aid the user in his/her analysis.
- [x] **Data Model Builder**: The data model builder is simple easy to use drag and drop UI based control mechanism that allows the user to build data models. The user can select the columns from multiple tables and even performs auto joins between tables that have a relation between them.

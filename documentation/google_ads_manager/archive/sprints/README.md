# Sprint Summaries - Historical Archive

This directory contains historical sprint summaries from the Google Ad Manager integration development process.

**Note**: These documents describe the development process and planning. **Not all features described in these sprints made it to the final simplified release.**

## Current Implementation

For the actual current implementation status, see:
- [`../CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`](../CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)
- [`../GOOGLE_AD_MANAGER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../GOOGLE_AD_MANAGER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

## What Changed

The final implementation was simplified to focus on core functionality:
- **Only 2 report types** (Revenue, Geography)
- **No advanced sync configuration**
- **No hourly sync**
- **No dashboard features**
- **Fixed date range** (Last 30 days)

These sprint summaries represent the original development planning, which included more features than the v1.0 release.

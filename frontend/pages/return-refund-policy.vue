        <h1>Return &amp; Refund Policy</h1>
        
        <p>
            Last updated: January 25, 2026
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>
            Thank you for subscribing to Data Research Analysis. This Return and Refund Policy explains our policies regarding refunds for our subscription-based data analytics and visualization platform services.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Data Research Analysis is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that provides instant access to data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation tools. Because our service is digital and access is granted immediately upon subscription, our refund policy differs from policies for physical products.
        </p>

        <h2>General Refund Policy</h2>

        <h3>No Refunds on Active Subscriptions</h3>
        
        <p>
            All subscription fees paid for Data Research Analysis are <strong>non-refundable</strong> as a general rule. This is because:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Our service is digital and access is granted immediately upon payment</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Resources are allocated for your account (storage, processing, AI generations)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Usage-based features (AI data modeling, data processing) cannot be "returned" once consumed</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A free tier is available for users to test the platform before committing to a paid subscription</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Free Tier Testing</h3>
        
        <p>
            We strongly encourage all prospective subscribers to thoroughly test our platform using the <strong>FREE tier</strong> before upgrading to a paid subscription. The FREE tier includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Up to 3 projects</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Up to 5 data sources per project</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Up to 5 dashboards</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>3 data models per data source</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>5 AI-generated data models per month</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Up to 100,000 rows per data model</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Access to all chart types and visualization features</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The FREE tier allows you to evaluate whether our platform meets your needs before making a financial commitment.
        </p>

        <h2>Exceptions and Special Circumstances</h2>

        <p>
            We may provide refunds in the following exceptional circumstances:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Billing Errors</h3>
        
        <p>
            If you are charged incorrectly due to a system error or technical malfunction on our part, we will issue a full refund for the erroneous charge. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Duplicate charges for the same subscription period</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Charges after subscription cancellation was properly processed</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Incorrect subscription tier charged</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Charges applied despite payment failure</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Extended Platform Downtime</h3>
        
        <p>
            If our platform experiences extended downtime (more than 72 consecutive hours) due to technical issues within our control, and you have not been able to access the service during your billing period, you may be eligible for a prorated refund for the downtime period.
        </p>
        <p>
            Planned maintenance windows and third-party service interruptions (Google Analytics API, Google Ads API, etc.) are not eligible for refunds.
        </p>

        <h3>3. First-Time Subscribers (7-Day Consideration Window)</h3>
        
        <p>
            For first-time paid subscribers upgrading from the FREE tier, we offer a <strong>7-day consideration window</strong> from the date of your first payment. Within this period, if you determine the paid features do not meet your needs, you may request a refund provided:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This is your first paid subscription with Data Research Analysis</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You request the refund within 7 days of the initial charge</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You have not exceeded 50% of your tier's monthly resource limits (projects, data sources, AI generations)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You provide specific feedback about why the service did not meet your expectations</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> This consideration window applies only once per customer and only to the first month of a new subscription.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Service Not As Described</h3>
        
        <p>
            If we make material changes to advertised features or capabilities after you subscribe, and these changes significantly reduce the value or functionality you subscribed for, you may request a prorated refund for the remaining subscription period.
        </p>
